ELSA-d (a demonstration mission) is the first mission to demonstrate the core technologies necessary for debris docking and removal ELSA-d consists of two spacecraft: a servicer satellite (mass of approximately 175 kg) and a client satellite (mass of approximately 17 kg), launched together in a stack. The servicer satellite has been developed to safely remove debris objects from orbit and is equipped with proximity rendezvous technologies and a magnetic docking mechanism. The client satellite is a piece of replica debris fitted with a ferromagnetic plate that enables the docking The servicer will repeatedly release and dock with the client in a series of technical demonstrations, proving the capability to find and dock with defunct satellites and other debris. Demonstrations include client search, inspection and rendezvous, and both non-tumbling and tumbling docking manoeuvres","State of registry notes in ST/SG/SER.E/1011 that ""The client satellite will be registered as a new space object after it is released from a servicer The ELSA-d servicer satellite and the ELSA-d client satellite are separately licensed for their mission operations under the Outer Space Act 1986 of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and are controlled in the United Kingdom in accordance with the provisions of the Act"".

The servicer satellite has been developed to safely remove debris objects from orbit and is equipped with proximity rendezvous technologies and a magnetic docking mechanism. The client satellite is a piece of replica debris fitted with a ferromagnetic plate that enables the docking The servicer will repeatedly release and dock with the client in a series of technical demonstrations, proving the capability to find and dock with defunct satellites and other debris. Demonstrations include client search, inspection and rendezvous, and both non-tumbling and tumbling docking manoeuvres","State of registry notes in ST/SG/SER.E/1011 that ""The client satellite will be registered as a new space object after it is released from a servicer The ELSA-d servicer satellite and the ELSA-d client satellite are separately licensed for their mission operations under the Outer Space Act 1986 of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and are controlled in the United Kingdom in accordance with the provisions of the Act"".

It is an ESA-led mission designed to explore the Sun and the heliosphere in order to investigate many of the fundamental problems remaining in solar and heliospheric science. Solar Orbiter is equipped with 10 instruments, including 4 in situ instruments for measuring properties of the ST/SG/SER.E/961 4/4 V.20-07707 environment in the vicinity of the spacecraft (solar wind plasma, electromagnetic fields and waves, and energetic particles, as close as 0.28 astronomical units), and remote-sensing instruments (for high-resolution imaging and spectroscopic observations of the Sun, including full-disk and coronal imaging). It has a nominal mission time of four years.",------,,,,,,,,,

Pursuant to the Agreement between the European Union, represented by the European Commission, and the European Space Agency on the Implementation of the Copernicus Programme, including the Transfer of Ownership of the Sentinels (Copernicus Agreement), which entered into force on 28 October 2014, ownership of Sentinel-2B was transferred to the European Union at the moment of lift-off of the satellite’s launch vehicle.",------,,,,,,,,,

The Trace Gas Orbiter will detect and monitor trace gases in the Martian atmosphere from an orbit approximately 400 km above the planet’s surface. The lander, Schiaparelli, is an entry, descent and landing demonstrator module that will test out technologies necessary for future lander missions. It carries a small payload of scientific instruments designed to make atmospheric measurements. ExoMars is a European Space Agency programme undertaken in conjunction with the Roscosmos State Corporation for Space Activities. An additional objective of the Trace Gas Orbiter is to serve as a data relay in communications between the ExoMars 2018 rover and the surface science platform. The full spacecraft has a launch mass of 4,332 kg, which includes the 600 kg Schiaparelli lander and propellant. The Trace Gas Orbiter is box-shaped and measures 3.2 m by 2 m by 2 m. It has two solar panel wings spanning 17.5 m. Schiaparelli is primarily a technology demonstration vehicle. Technologies being tested include special thermal protection material, the parachute system, a radar Doppler altimeter, and a liquid-propulsion braking system. Schiaparelli is disc-shaped, with a diameter of 1.65 m, protected on entry by a 2.4 m diameter heat shield. Total mass is 600 kg. Power is provided by batteries only. The batteries are expected to provide power for two to eight days of surface operations. After a seven-month cruise, the spacecraft reached Mars in October 2016. Three days prior to reaching Mars, the Schiaparelli lander was released.",Mentioned by the Russian Federation in ST/SG/SER.E/771.,,,,,,,,,

The 3,400 kg spacecraft carries three instruments: the Photodetector Array Camera and Spectrometer (PACS), the Spectral and Photometric Imaging Receiver (SPIRE) and the Heterodyne Instrument for the Far Infrared (HIFI), Herschel also carries 2,300 litres of liquid helium to cool the instruments to a few tenths of a degree above zero Kelvin (-273.15 degrees Celsius).

This radiation is expected to provide scientists with detailed information about the age of the universe and the size, mass and geometry of the early universe. Planck is expected to produce two all-sky maps before the end of the mission, which is nominally to last 15 months. Planck has a mass of approximately 1,900 kg, carries a mirror with a 1.5 m aperture and two cryogenically cooled instruments, the High Frequency Instrument (HFI) and the Low Frequency Instrument (LFI).

GOCE is designed to measure Earth’s gravitational field to create very high-resolution maps of the geoid. These maps will provide the baseline for measurements of ocean circulation and sea-level change. The 1,100 kg spacecraft is 5 m long by 1 m wide and its fixed solar arrays will produce 1.3 kW of power. The satellite carries six high-sensitivity accelerometers arranged along the three axes of the spacecraft. To acquire high-resolution measurements, the satellite must travel at a low orbital altitude at which atmospheric drag effects are still significant. To compensate for these effects, the satellite has a sleek arrow-shaped design to reduce drag and small winglets and a tail fin for stabilization. GOCE’s orbital altitude will also be maintained with the assistance of an on board ion engine.",Mentioned by Russian Federation in ST/SG/SER.E/567.,,,,,,,,,
